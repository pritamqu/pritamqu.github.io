*I am interested in advancing safe multimodal intelligence and in designing algorithms that require little to no human supervision.*

I completed my PhD in 2025 at [Queen’s University, Canada](https://queensu.ca/), where I was also affiliated with the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). 
During my PhD, I interned at [Google](https://research.google/) and [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com/). I joined [Queen's University](https://queensu.ca/) in 2018 and completed my master's degree in 2020, and subsequently began my PhD. Prior to that, I worked for about three years as a Software Engineer at [Infosys](https://www.infosys.com/) and [Tech Mahindra](https://www.techmahindra.com/). I completed my bachelor's degree in 2015 from [West Bengal University of Technology, India](/). Outside of research, I am passionate about photography and film-making.

<p><mark class="red">
I am exploring full-time opportunities and would be glad to connect if my experience aligns with your needs. <br>
I also welcome research collaborations and speaking engagements, please feel free to reach out.

### [Research](./research.md)
<hr>

My current research focus is **multimodal AI with image, video, audio, and language**. 

Broadly interested in: generative models (LLMs, multimodal LLMs, diffusion models), foundation models (video, image, vision-language, audio-visual), representation learning (self-supervised, unsupervised), alignment, reasoning, AI agents, computer vision.
Please find more about my research [here](./research.md).

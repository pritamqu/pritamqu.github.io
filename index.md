I will be joining [Google Research](https://research.google/) as a Student Researcher starting from October 2023. I am a PhD candidate at [Queen’s University, Canada](https://queensu.ca/) and affiliated with [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). 
My research is primarily focused on self-supervised learning to learn meaningful representations without (or with minimal) human supervision. Earlier, I interened at [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com/) in Fall 2022. I joined [Queen's](https://queensu.ca/) in 2018 and completed my master's in 2020. Prior to that, I worked as a Software Engineer for approximately total of 3 years in [Infosys](https://www.infosys.com/) and [Tech Mahindra](https://www.techmahindra.com/). I completed my bachelor's in 2015 from [West Bengal University of Technology, India](/).


### [Research](./research.md)
<hr>
I am interested in self-/un-supervised learning, computer vision, video understanding, multimodal learning (i.e., vision-language, audio-visual), out-of-distribution generalization, large-scale pretraining of foundational models in vision and multimodal domains, understanding the high-level context from long videos, among a few others. Please find more about my research [here](./research.md).


<!-- <div><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I am looking for new opportunities, please feel free to reach out if you have any openings.</strong></span></div> -->

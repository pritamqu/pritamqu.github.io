Currently, I am a PhD candidate at [Queen’s University](https://queensu.ca/) and affiliated with the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/). 
Earlier, I interned at [Google](https://research.google/) and [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com/). I joined [Queen's University](https://queensu.ca/) in 2018 and completed my master's degree in 2020. Prior to that, I worked as a Software Engineer for a total of approximately 3 years at [Infosys](https://www.infosys.com/) and [Tech Mahindra](https://www.techmahindra.com/). I completed my bachelor's degree in 2015 from [West Bengal University of Technology, India](/). Other than research, I am passionate about photography and film-making.



### [Research](./research.md)
<hr>

My current research focus is **video and multimodal learning**. 
Specifically, multimodal learning with vision, language, and audio, video understanding, representation learning, self-supervised and unsupervised learning, multimodal LLMs, large vision-language models, foundation models and computer vision. Please find more about my research [here](./research.md).
